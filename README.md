# Terraform-Essentials

This repo will guide us on IAC,the basics of setting up and using the tool Terraform on AWS.

## Definition of Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a concept and practice in software engineering and system administration that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable script files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. The idea is to treat infrastructure configurations as code, applying software development practices to infrastructure management.

## Key aspects of Infrastructure as Code include:

**Declarative Configuration** : IaC relies on declarative rather than imperative code. Instead of specifying step-by-step instructions on how to achieve a particular configuration, you declare the desired state of your infrastructure, and the IaC tool takes care of figuring out how to make it happen.

**Version Control**: IaC scripts are typically stored in version control systems (like Git), allowing teams to track changes, roll back to previous versions, and collaborate effectively.

**Reusability** : Code can be modularized and reused, promoting consistency across different environments and making it easier to manage complex infrastructure configurations.

**Automation** : IaC tools automate the process of provisioning and configuring infrastructure, reducing manual errors, and increasing efficiency. This can be particularly valuable in the context of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

**Idempotency**: IaC should be idempotent, meaning that applying the same configuration multiple times results in the same outcome as applying it once. This property ensures that you can repeatedly apply the configuration without unintended side effects.
